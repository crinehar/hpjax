## 🚀 Pre-Launch Checklist — Must Complete Before Go-Live

### Shopify
- [ ] Upgrade Shopify dev store to **Basic plan ($29/mo)** — removes password gate, enables live checkout
- [ ] Enable remaining gift card variants in Shopify admin (confirm all $25/$50/$100 are `availableForSale`)
- [ ] Add remaining gift card products from WooCommerce store into Shopify (50 Min Massage GC, etc.)
- [ ] Connect custom domain in Shopify (for checkout branding — shows `hpjax.com` not `hpjax.myshopify.com`)
- [ ] Set up Shopify Payments or Stripe as payment processor
- [ ] Configure gift card email delivery template in Shopify admin
- [ ] Remove Shopify demo products (snowboards, ski wax) — only gift cards should be in the store

### Vercel Environment Variables
- [ ] Confirm `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_DOMAIN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN` are set for **Production + Preview + Development** (currently Production only)
- [ ] Add `RESEND_API_KEY` when contact form is wired
- [ ] Add `MAILCHIMP_*` vars when newsletter is wired
- [ ] Add `WORDPRESS_API_URL` when blog is connected

### Analytics & Tracking (needs IDs from client)
- [ ] **Google Analytics 4** — add `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` env var, wire `next/script strategy="afterInteractive"` in `app/layout.tsx`
- [ ] **Google Tag Manager** — alternative to direct GA4; add GTM container snippet via `next/script`
- [ ] **Facebook Pixel** — add `FB_PIXEL_ID` env var, wire Meta Pixel base code via `next/script strategy="afterInteractive"`
- [ ] **Google Search Console** — verify ownership (HTML tag method via Next.js `verification` metadata)
- [ ] **Vercel Analytics** — already in `package.json`, just needs `<Analytics />` added to `app/layout.tsx`
- [ ] **Vercel Speed Insights** — same, add `<SpeedInsights />` to `app/layout.tsx`

### Content
- [ ] Real hero photos for homepage and service pages
- [ ] Team member names, headshots, and bios (`/our-team`)
- [ ] Final copy review on all service pages (pull verbatim from live WP site)
- [ ] Google Maps embed on `/contact`
- [ ] OG image — proper 1200×630 PNG at `public/images/og-default.png`
- [ ] Favicon / `app/favicon.ico`
- [ ] Real patient testimonials (replace placeholder carousel)
- [ ] Privacy Policy page (`/privacy-policy`) — **required before running Facebook Pixel**
- [ ] Cookie consent banner — **required for GDPR/CCPA compliance with GA4 + FB Pixel**

### SEO & Technical
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console (`https://hpjax.com/sitemap.xml`)
- [ ] Verify all 301 redirects from old WordPress URLs are in `next.config.mjs`
- [ ] Run final Lighthouse audit on production URL (target: 100/100/100/100)
- [ ] Test all forms end-to-end (contact, newsletter)
- [ ] Test Shopify checkout end-to-end on live paid store
