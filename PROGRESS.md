## 🚀 Pre-Launch Checklist — Must Complete Before Go-Live

### Shopify
- [ ] Upgrade Shopify dev store to **Basic plan ($29/mo)** — removes password gate, enables live checkout
- [ ] Enable remaining gift card variants in Shopify admin (confirm all $25/$50/$100 are `availableForSale`)
- [ ] Add remaining gift card products from WooCommerce store into Shopify (50 Min Massage GC, etc.)
- [ ] Connect custom domain in Shopify (for checkout branding — shows `hpjax.com` not `hpjax.myshopify.com`)
- [ ] Set up Shopify Payments or Stripe as payment processor
- [ ] Configure gift card email delivery template in Shopify admin
- [ ] Remove Shopify demo products (snowboards, ski wax) — only gift cards should be in the store

- [ ] Add `RESEND_API_KEY` when contact form is wired
- [ ] Add `MAILCHIMP_*` vars when newsletter is wired

- [ ] **Google Tag Manager** — alternative to direct GA4
- [ ] **Facebook Pixel** — add `FB_PIXEL_ID` env var

### Content
- [ ] Real hero photos for homepage and remaining service pages
- [x] Team member names, headshots, and bios — all 6 sub-pages complete

- [ ] Favicon / `app/favicon.ico`
- [x] Real patient testimonials — 129 WP reviews imported
- [ ] Privacy Policy page (`/privacy-policy`) — **required before running Facebook Pixel**
- [ ] Cookie consent banner — **required for GDPR/CCPA compliance with GA4 + FB Pixel**

### SEO & Technical
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console (`https://hpjax.com/sitemap.xml`)
- [ ] Verify all remaining 301 redirects from old WordPress URLs

## 🎯 Next Session Priorities

1. **Women's Health pages** — `/womens-health`, `/services/fertility-acupuncture-jacksonville-fl-aborm-certified-dr-julee-miller`, `/pelvic-floor` full rebuilds with WP copy, images, ADA/AIO
2. **Analytics** — wire GA4 + FB Pixel once IDs are provided
3. **Shopify upgrade** — test full checkout end-to-end on paid plan
4. **WordPress redirects** — map any remaining old WP URLs before DNS cutover
5. **Live chat** — add floating chat widget embed code

## 📧 Client Follow-Up Email — Pending

Send follow-up email summarizing key improvements over the live WordPress site. Include:

### Performance & Technical
- Next.js 14 SSG — pages served as static HTML (no PHP/WordPress overhead)
- Target PageSpeed 100/100/100/100 vs current WP scores
- Sub-100KB first-load JS bundle
- All images converted to next/image with lazy loading, explicit dimensions, priority prop on heroes
- No render-blocking scripts — all third-party JS deferred

### SEO Image Renaming
All images renamed from generic/hash filenames to descriptive kebab-case SEO filenames. Examples:
- `shutterstock_617618081-scaled-1.jpg` → `b12-nutrition-metabolism-jacksonville-fl.jpg`
- `AcupuncturePointInjectionTherapy.webp` → `acupuncture-point-injection-therapy-jacksonville-fl.webp`
- `rsw_1200h_600cg_true.webp` → `o3-ozone-therapy-jacksonville-fl.webp`
- `cosmeticacu.jpg` → `cosmetic-facial-acupuncture-treatment-jacksonville-fl.jpg`
- (all service, team, and hero images renamed similarly)

### ADA / WCAG 2.2 AA
- Native semantic HTML — no accessibility overlay widget
- Skip-to-content link, proper landmark regions on every page
- One H1 per page, logical heading hierarchy enforced

- All external links include `aria-label` with "(opens in new tab)"

- ARIA live regions on dynamic content (testimonial carousel)
- `<details>`/`<summary>` for accordions — keyboard accessible, no JS required

### AIO / LLM Readability
- Clean SSG HTML with low rendered content percentage
- JSON-LD schema on every page: MedicalWebPage, Service, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, LocalBusiness, Person
- Service pages include `hasOfferCatalog` listing all treatment offerings
- FAQ sections with question-framed headings on every service page
- NAP (name, address, phone) as plain HTML in every page footer
- `llms.txt` in /public

---
