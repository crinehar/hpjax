## 🎯 Next Session Priority — ADA Score to 100

**Current PageSpeed scores (hpjax.vercel.app — 2026-05-21):**
| Category | Score |
|---|---|
| Performance | 92 |
| Accessibility | 86 ← focus here |
| Best Practices | 100 ✅ |
| SEO | 92 |

**Goal:** Accessibility 86 → 100. Work through every Lighthouse accessibility failure systematically.

**Known issues to address:**
- [ ] Run full Lighthouse accessibility report and capture all failing audits
- [ ] Fix any color contrast failures (ink-muted, ink-subtle on white/surface backgrounds)
- [ ] Audit `<ScrollReveal>` (renders `<div>`) inside `<ul>` — invalid HTML, screen readers affected
- [ ] Verify `lang` attribute and page `<title>` on all routes
- [ ] Audit focus order / tab sequence on mobile nav and dropdowns
- [ ] Verify all interactive states are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Check `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls` wiring on Header dropdowns
- [ ] Audit form error announcement timing
- [ ] TopBanner `role="banner"` conflicts with `<header>` landmark (both are banner role)
